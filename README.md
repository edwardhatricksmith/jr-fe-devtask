World Nomads Group - FE Exercise
=====

The purpose of this exercise is to help us get an idea of your front end development fundamentals.

_There is no score card for this exercise. You may do as much or as little as you choose, however we recommend you aim to spend around **1 hour**._

## Instructions

We've created this lovely new website for [World Nomads Group](http://www.worldnomadsgroup.com/). Unfortunately because of time constraints we did it in a rush. As such we've introduced a range of bugs, errors and general poor coding practices.

Your task is to help us fix these bugs, resolve any errors and tidy up some of our sloppy code :D

A few things to keep an eye out for:

1. The html is not very semantic.
2. Our headings aren't responsive. They should adjust based on screen sizes.
3. There are a number of bugs and errors.
4. Best practice for css and js resources wasn't followed.

## Bonus points for experts

1. Concatenate and minify our JS and CSS resources. You could do this with Gulp.
2. Improve the CSS by implementing some modular CSS practices.

## Development tips

While you could start by simply editing the files, we suggest you get [Gulp running first](https://gulpjs.com/).

From your terminal/shell:

1. `git clone git@github.com:edwardhatricksmith/jr-fe-devtask.git`
2. `cd jr-fe-devtask`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`

## Submitting your work

Create a new Github repository with the following naming convention: https://github.com/yourusername/surname-fe-exercise

Forward the link to this repository back to your recruiter or WNG contact. It will be used as the basis for an technical interview.
